# Basic Alexa Skill Template


This is a fork / simplified version of the Amazon [How to build a skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto) example.


### Usage

```text
Alexa, launch "How old is"

How old is Chris
How old is Mandy
How old is Madeleine
```

### Repository Contents
* `/.ask`	- [ASK CLI (Command Line Interface) Configuration](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html)	 
* `/lambda/custom` - Back-End Logic for the Alexa Skill hosted on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* `/models` - Voice User Interface and Language Specific Interaction Models
* `skill.json`	- [Skill Manifest](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-manifest.html)

## Setup w/ ASK CLI

### Pre-requisites

* Node.js (> v4.3)
* Register for an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Register for an [Amazon Developer Account](https://developer.amazon.com/)
* Install and Setup [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.

	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/MrChrisBarker/AlexaSkillTemplate.git
	```

2. Initiatialize the [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html) by Navigating into the repository and running npm command: `ask init`. Follow the prompts.

	```bash
	$ cd AlexaSkillTemplate
	$ ask init
	```

3. Install npm dependencies by navigating into the `/lambda/custom` directory and running the npm command: `npm install`

	```bash
	$ cd lambda/custom
	$ npm install
	```


### Deployment

ASK CLI will create the skill and the lambda function for you. The Lambda function will be created in ```us-east-1 (Northern Virginia)``` by default.

1. Deploy the skill and the lambda function in one step by running the following command:

	```bash
	$ ask deploy
	```

### Testing

1. To test, you need to login to Alexa Developer Console, and enable the "Test" switch on your skill from the "Test" Tab.

### Lambda Updates

1. Once your skill has been deployed you can make changes directly on the Alexa Developer Console (utterances, slots, slot values etc..). However if you require changes to your Lambda you can re-deploy this straight though the ASK CLI.

    ```bash
    $ ask deploy --target lambda
    ```

## Customization

1. ```./skill.json```

   Change the skill name, example phrase, icons, testing instructions etc ...

   Remember that many information is locale-specific and must be changed for each locale (en-GB and en-US)

   See the Skill [Manifest Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-manifest.html) for more information.

2. ```./lambda/custom/index.js```

   Modify messages, and facts from the source code to customize the skill.

3. ```./models/*.json```

	Change the model definition to replace the invocation name and the sample phrase for each intent.  Repeat the operation for each locale you are planning to support.
